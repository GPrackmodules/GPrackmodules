**AB4 - Simple four way A/B switcher**

![AB4 Module](AB4.png "The AB4 Module") &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;![AB4 Module](AB4-dark.png "The AB4 Module")

This module is a simple polyphonic A/B switcher. The four output signals are either fed from the four A inputs signals or the for B inputs. A button controls the A/B selection, and an indicator shows which group of inputs is selected. All channels of polyphonic input cables are carried from the selected input to the output sockets. AB4 does not distinguish between audio, CV or trigger signals.

Please note that AB4 does not understand which signals are triggers, which might need to be ended before switching. This can lead to short bleeps when switching GATE signals through AB4.
